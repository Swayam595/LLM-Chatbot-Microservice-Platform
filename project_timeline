# üóìÔ∏è LLM-Powered Chatbot Development Timeline (with AI Assistance)

This timeline outlines the 5-week development plan for building a scalable, modular, LLM-powered chatbot using Python microservices, AI-assisted tooling (ChatGPT, Cursor), and clean architecture principles.

---

## üìÜ Week-by-Week Timeline

### ‚úÖ Week 1: Project Setup & Architecture
- Define core features and microservices
- Design high-level architecture (textual diagram + components)
- Set up project monorepo with `poetry` or `pipenv`
- Scaffold each microservice: `auth-service`, `chatbot-service`, `conversation-service`, `api-gateway`
- Create `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yaml`, `Makefile`
- Document everything

### ‚úÖ Week 2: Auth + Conversation + API Gateway
- Implement `auth-service` (JWT login/registration)
- Build `conversation-service` (PostgreSQL chat history)
- Set up routing and logic in `api-gateway`
- Establish service-to-service communication
- Define OpenAPI schemas (FastAPI + Pydantic)
- Add basic health checks

### ‚úÖ Week 3: Chatbot Service & LLM Integration
- Integrate with OpenAI or Hugging Face
- Implement context-aware prompt chaining
- Abstract LLM provider with Strategy pattern
- Add retry/fallback logic for model failures
- Build endpoint: `POST /chat`

### ‚úÖ Week 4: LLD Patterns, Refactor, Testing
- Refactor with clean architecture + design patterns:
  - Repository, Factory, Strategy, Builder
- Implement unit & integration tests (`pytest`, `httpx`)
- Mock external APIs (OpenAI)
- Add structured logging + observability (Loguru)
- Implement context memory with Redis (optional)

### ‚úÖ Week 5: Frontend + CI/CD + Final Polish
- Build UI with Streamlit or React
- Connect frontend to API Gateway
- Add GitHub Actions for linting, testing, and Docker build
- Final review, README, architecture diagram, deployment
