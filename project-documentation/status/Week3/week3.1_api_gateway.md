# ✅ Week 3: API Gateway - Implementation Summary

This document outlines the goals, implementation steps, and current status for the `api-gateway` microservice built in **Week 3** of the LLM Chatbot Microservice Platform.

---

## 📌 Purpose
The `api-gateway` serves as the **central entrypoint** to the platform:
- Routes client requests to internal services (auth, chatbot, conversation)
- Verifies authentication and access
- Enforces rate limiting
- Logs requests and responses
- Provides health endpoints

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. 🧱 Project Setup
- [x] FastAPI app with `main.py`
- [x] Organized structure: `routes/`, `services/`, `middlewares/`, `utils/`, `dependencies/`

### 2. 🚪 Routing & Proxy
- [x] Route `/chatbot/chat` to `chatbot-service`
- [x] Route `/auth/verify-token` to `auth-service`
- [x] Route `/conversations/...` to `conversation-service`

### 3. 🔐 Authentication Middleware
- [x] Intercepts all non-`/auth/*` routes
- [x] Forwards token to `auth-service` for validation
- [x] Handles invalid or missing tokens with `401`

### 4. 💨 Rate Limiting
- [x] Implemented Redis-backed rate limiter
- [x] Configurable IP-based sliding window logic
- [x] Keys tracked as sorted sets in Redis (`ratelimit:<ip>`)

### 5. 📜 Logging
- [x] Basic logging middleware added
- [x] Logs method, path, status code

### 6. 🧪 Health Checks
- [x] `/health` endpoint (checks self and dependencies)
- [x] `/health/all` returns status of all services in detail

### 7. 🐳 Docker Integration
- [x] Added Dockerfile for gateway
- [x] Registered in `docker-compose.yml`
- [x] Accessible at `localhost:8000`

## 🔧 Pending Enhancements (Optional)

| Feature                         | Priority | Description                                  |
|---------------------------------|----------|----------------------------------------------|
| `ServiceError` abstraction      | Medium   | Uniform error wrapping for downstream calls  |
| Add request ID tracing          | Medium   | For observability and correlation            |
| Swagger/OpenAPI tagging         | Low      | Group endpoints under appropriate sections   |
| Circuit breaker (Tenacity)      | Low      | Retry failed services with fallback          |

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Integrate full end-to-end flow via Gateway
- Add test suite (unit + integration)
- Expand Swagger for frontend devs
- Optionally integrate observability (request IDs, metrics)

> ✅ **Gateway is now stable and can serve production-like requests.**
> All downstream services are protected, rate-limited, and accessible behind a secure, unified interface.
