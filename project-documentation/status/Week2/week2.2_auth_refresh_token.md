# ✅ Week 2: Authentication & Authorization – Progress Report

This document captures the status, accomplishments, and pending tasks for Week 2 of the `auth-service` in the LLM Chatbot Microservice Platform.

---

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. 🔐 User Registration (`/register`)
- Password hashing using `passlib` and bcrypt
- Input validation via `pydantic` schema
- Checks for duplicate emails

### 2. 🔓 User Login (`/login`)
- JWT-based login with token generation
- Role included in JWT payload
- Secure error responses on wrong credentials

### 3. 🧠 PostgreSQL Integration
- Configured PostgreSQL container in `docker-compose.yml`
- Database access via SQLAlchemy (async)
- Clean code structure with repositories & services

### 4. ⚙️ Config Management
- Environment variables loaded via `.env`
- Centralized `Config` class in `config.py`
- Injected into JWT utilities and other modules

### 5. ✅ Middleware: JWT Auth & Current User (`/me`)
- Middleware for extracting and verifying tokens
- Protected endpoint `/me` shows current user info

### 6. 👮 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Custom dependency `require_role(role)`
- Implemented protected route `/admin-only`

### 7. ♻️ Token Refresh Flow (`/refresh`)
- Refresh token with extended expiry
- New access token issued when old expires
- Token type differentiation (`"access"` vs `"refresh"`)

### 8. 📜 Logging Setup
- Shared logger in `shared/logger.py`
- Log level configurable via `.env`
- Injected into services using constructor

## 📌 What's Next in `auth-service` (Week 3 Goals)

| Feature | Description | Priority |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| 🔒 Logout/Token Revocation | Invalidate refresh tokens (store in DB or memory) | Medium |
| 🔁 Password Reset Flow | `/forgot-password`, `/reset-password` with email token | Medium |
| 🧪 Unit & Integration Tests | Test `/register`, `/login`, token middleware, RBAC | High |
| 👤 User Profile API | `/users/{id}` or `/profile` to fetch/update profile | Optional |
| 🛡️ Refresh Token DB Store | Prevent misuse by saving issued refresh tokens | Optional |
| 🚪 OAuth or SSO Support | Google/Microsoft login integration | Optional |
| ⏱️ Rate Limiting | Protect `/register` and `/login` from abuse | Optional |

---

## 🧠 Suggestions

- Separate refresh token handling logic into its own `RefreshTokenService`
- Build a test coverage dashboard with `pytest-cov` and CI integration
- Define OpenAPI tags & group endpoints for docs

✅ **Auth-service is production-ready for MVP!**
Let’s proceed with Week 3: token lifecycle improvements and testing.
