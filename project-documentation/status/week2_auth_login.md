# üóìÔ∏è Week 2: Auth Service - Register & Login

This document captures the progress and remaining tasks for **Week 2** of the LLM Chatbot Microservice project.

---

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Implement `/register` endpoint in `auth_service`
- Created `UserCreate` schema with validation using Pydantic.
- Passwords hashed securely using **bcrypt** with `passlib`.
- Registered users stored in **PostgreSQL** using SQLAlchemy.
- Error handling for duplicate email registration.

### 2. Setup PostgreSQL
- Added `postgres` container in `docker-compose.yml`.
- Connection string injected using `DATABASE_URL` env var.
- `database.py` implemented using **SQLAlchemy AsyncSession**.
- Connection follows **SOLID** principles and clean structure.

### 3. Implement `/login` endpoint in `auth_service`
- Login schema validated with `UserLogin` Pydantic model.
- JWT generated using `python-jose` and `HS256` algorithm.
- Environment variables used for `SECRET_KEY`, `ALGORITHM`, and `EXPIRY`.
- Tokens returned as `{ access_token, token_type }`.

### 4. Configuration Handling
- Central `config.py` reads from `.env` via `python-dotenv`.
- Injected config into services instead of hardcoding values.

### 5. Dockerized Auth Service
- Updated `Dockerfile` to use Poetry and copy `.env`.
- Added `PYTHONPATH=/app` for cross-module imports.
- `auth_service` runs on `localhost:8001`.

### 6. Imports and Path Fixes
- Adjusted VS Code settings for `python.analysis.extraPaths`.
- Ensured relative imports work with `PYTHONPATH` set in compose.

## ‚ùå Incomplete / In Progress

- [ ] ‚ö†Ô∏è **Logging setup**
  - Shared `Logger` class exists but not injected across services.
  - `LOG_LEVEL` from `.env` not fully wired through Docker.

---

## ‚ö° Remaining Tasks for Week 2

- [ ] Add proper logging with a shared `Logger` class.
- [ ] Inject `Logger` into services via constructors.
- [ ] Use logger for registration, login, and error flows.
- [ ] Begin writing unit tests for `/register` and `/login`.
- [ ] Write documentation for `auth_service` endpoints.
