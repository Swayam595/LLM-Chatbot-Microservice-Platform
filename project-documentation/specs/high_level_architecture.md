# 🏗️ High-Level Architecture for LLM-Powered Chatbot Microservice Platform

This document defines the high-level architecture and service interactions for the chatbot system. It includes a **textual system diagram**, individual component responsibilities, and communication flows.

---

## 🧠 System Overview

A modular microservice architecture designed to support:

- LLM-based chatbot interactions
- Context memory and conversation storage
- Authenticated users
- Scalable backend services
- Extensibility via plugins/tools (optional)

```

## 🧩 Component Responsibilities

### 1. **API Gateway**
- Entry point for all clients
- Routes requests to services
- Handles:
  - Authentication verification
  - Rate limiting
  - Logging
  - Request validation

---

### 2. **Auth Service**
- Manages user accounts and sessions
- JWT token generation and validation
- APIs:
  - `POST /register`
  - `POST /login`
  - `POST /refresh-token`

---

### 3. **Chatbot Service**
- Receives user input
- Constructs prompt using context from Conversation Service
- Calls external LLM APIs (OpenAI, Claude, etc.)
- Response handling and tool invocation
- Supports:
  - Multiple LLM providers (Strategy Pattern)
  - Tool/agent-based augmentation
- APIs:
  - `POST /chat`

---

### 4. **Conversation Service**
- Stores and retrieves chat history
- Interfaces with:
  - PostgreSQL for durable storage
  - Redis for quick access to recent messages
  - Vector DB (e.g., FAISS/Chroma) for semantic search
- APIs:
  - `POST /messages`
  - `GET /history?user_id=...`

---

### 5. **LLM Provider / Tool Layer**
- External API integration (OpenAI, HuggingFace)
- Optional toolset via plugin system:
  - Weather, calculator, API fetcher, etc.
- Abstractions like:
  ```python
  class Tool:
      def run(self, query: str) -> str: ...
  ```

---

## 📦 Data Flow Example

1. User sends a message via Frontend.
2. API Gateway validates token → routes to Chatbot Service.
3. Chatbot Service pulls context from Conversation Service.
4. Chatbot sends prompt to LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI).
5. Response is returned to user and stored in Conversation Service.

## 🧰 Stack Overview

| Layer               | Tech Stack                           |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Web/API Layer       | FastAPI, Pydantic                     |
| Auth                | JWT, PyJWT                            |
| Chatbot Logic       | OpenAI API, LangChain (optional)     |
| Persistence         | PostgreSQL, Redis, ChromaDB/FAISS    |
| Messaging (Optional)| Kafka or RabbitMQ                    |
| Testing             | Pytest, HTTPX                         |
| DevOps              | Docker, GitHub Actions, NGINX (ingress) |

## 🔄 Extensibility

- Add new tools by registering them with ToolFactory
- Support more LLMs by adding to Strategy pattern
- Extend memory via vector storage (RAG)

---

## ✅ Next Steps

- [ ] Finalize OpenAPI contracts for each service
- [ ] Scaffold directory and interfaces
- [ ] Implement auth and conversation modules
