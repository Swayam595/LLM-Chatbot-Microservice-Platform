# 🚀 Feature Definition & System Architecture

## 🎯 Goal
Design and define the overall functionality, core features, and architecture for the LLM-powered chatbot microservice platform.

---

## ✅ Core Features

### 🔐 Authentication (Auth Service)
- User registration and login
- JWT-based authentication and token refresh

### 💬 Chatbot Interaction (Chatbot Service)
- Accept user prompts and return LLM-generated responses
- Use OpenAI GPT-4 or other pluggable LLMs (Mistral, Claude, etc.)
- Support tool/agent-based extensions (e.g., weather, calculations)

### 🧠 Context Memory (Conversation Service)
- Maintain user conversation history (short-term & long-term)
- Store chats in PostgreSQL
- Enable memory summarization and retrieval

### 🔄 API Gateway
- Route requests to appropriate microservices
- Central point for logging, authentication, and rate limiting

### 🧰 Extensibility
- Support tool plugins (LangChain-style)
- LLM strategy switching
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with Vector DB

### 🧪 Testing & Observability
- Unit + integration testing setup with pytest
- Logging, health checks, and error tracking
